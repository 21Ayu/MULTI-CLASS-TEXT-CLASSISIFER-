# Key Objectives: In this hackathon:

1. Data Exploration and Preparation:
   - Explore and analyze the dataset to understand key features, detect missing data, and identify ambiguities.
   - Preprocess the dataset for consistency, noise reduction, and missing value handling.

2. Descriptive Analysis:
   - Perform descriptive analysis to identify data patterns, category distributions, and inconsistencies.
   - Visualize data insights to guide feature engineering and model development.

3. Feature Engineering/Text to Features:
   - Transform raw product data into informative features suitable for machine learning models.
   - Convert text descriptions into numerical features using techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, or custom methods.

4. Predictive Modeling â€“ Multi class text classifier:
   - Design and develop multi-class text classifier for accurate product categorization.
   - Consider classification, clustering, or hybrid models based on problem requirements.
   - Ensure the model can handle ambiguous products 

5. Fine Tuning:
   - Optimize models by tuning hyperparameters and selecting relevant features.
   - Evaluate and compare models using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.
   - Validate models through cross-validation or a separate test dataset.

6. Enhance Categorization Accuracy:
   - Improve model accuracy by incorporating domain-specific knowledge or ensemble methods.
   - Ensure solutions can accurately categorize unconventional product names and handle ambiguities.
   - Develop models that support scalable, real-time categorization.
